// I want to use this moo() function from a company 'otherc++File'. I will get dll & a lib file from them which I will
// need to compile and use it.

void moo();

------------------------------------------- THIS IS MY COMPANY'S CODE written in an other file -----------------------------------------------

// if I had a company and I wish that when I ship my product, others can use it, then I mention about dllexport
// we write keyword 'dllexport' , so that when I make a library file or dll, I want this visibly callable outside
// that library, meaning want others to use my product, hence when I ship a dll or lib file, any customer having
// exe file can use "moo" function

//Note: we dont ship .exe file to customers, we ship dll (dynamic link library) and a library file 


#include <iostream>

_declspec(dllexport) void moo() 
{
    std::cout<<"moo"<<std::endl;
