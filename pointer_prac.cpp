// type of pointer should match the type of source(value)
// in case want to achieve that we can create void pointer
// void pointer can point to any datatype
// it is to remember if a pointer is just declared and not initialized thenm it contains a random value, thus we must initialize it. In some cases compiler willl point an error and will not compile the code
// always initialize pointers and variables. NULL, if we just want to keep a pointer. nullptr should be used instead of NULL macro. We cannot read from nullptr if we try to then it causes read violation, if we try to write to null pointer then we run into write violation.
